# 🚀 Features
- Declarative Syntax – Write reports using a clear, English-like structure

- Data Aggregation – Support for SUM, COUNT, AVERAGE, MAX, MIN with GROUP BY

- Calculated Columns – Create new columns using arithmetic expressions

- Flexible Filtering – Apply conditional filters on columns

- Multiple Output Formats – Generate tables, bar charts, or pie charts

- Semantic Validation – Built-in checks for data type consistency and reference integrity

- Extensible – Designed to work with different data sources (SQL, CSV, etc.)

# 🎯 The Problem Every Business Faces
"Our analysts spend 70% of their time writing and debugging SQL/Python reports instead of analyzing data."

Sound familiar? You have data in databases, spreadsheets, or APIs. You need:

- Daily sales dashboards

- Monthly performance reports

- Regional comparisons

- Executive summaries

- But each report requires:

- Complex SQL queries

- Python/Pandas scripting

- Formatting headaches

- Chart customization

- Endless debugging

Time wasted: 2-5 days per report.

# 💡 The Solution: Report DSL
Report DSL is a business-friendly language that lets you define reports in plain English, while generating production-ready outputs automatically.

📖 DSL Syntax Example
```
REPORT Regional_Sales_Complex TITLE "Sales Analysis Report";

DATA_SOURCE GlobalSales: TYPE SQL_DB QUERY "SELECT region, amount, cost, units, date FROM all_sales";

FILTER {
    date <= "2023-12-31";
    units >= 10;
}

AGGREGATE TotalRevenue SUM(amount) GROUP_BY region;
AGGREGATE TotalUnits SUM(units) GROUP_BY region;
AGGREGATE AvgSalePrice AS TotalRevenue / TotalUnits;

LAYOUT CHART_BAR {
    COLUMN region AS "Sales Region";
    COLUMN TotalRevenue AS "Total Revenue" FORMAT "CURRENCY";
    COLUMN AvgSalePrice AS "Average Price" FORMAT "DECIMAL_2";
    SORT_BY TotalRevenue DESC;
}
```
Output (What You Get Automatically):
Table Output:
```
Sales Territory     Revenue       # Customers   Avg Value per Customer
---------------     -------       -----------   ----------------------
North America       $1,250,000    1,250        $1,000
Europe              $890,000      920          $967
Asia Pacific        $740,000      850          $870
TOTAL               $2,880,000    
```

## 🔧 Getting Started in 5 Minutes

Step 1: Install
```
pip install report-dsl
```
Step 2: Write Your First Report

Create a file called sales_report.rdsl:
example
```
REPORT MonthlySales TITLE "January 2024 Sales Report";

DATA_SOURCE SalesDB: TYPE SQL_DB QUERY "SELECT region, amount, units, date FROM sales";

FILTER {
    date >= "2024-01-01";
    region != "Test";
}

AGGREGATE Revenue SUM(amount) GROUP_BY region;
AGGREGATE UnitsSold SUM(units) GROUP_BY region;
CALCULATE AvgPrice AS Revenue / UnitsSold;

LAYOUT TABLE_VIEW {
    COLUMN region AS "Sales Region";
    COLUMN Revenue AS "Total Revenue" FORMAT "CURRENCY";
    COLUMN UnitsSold AS "Units Sold";
    COLUMN AvgPrice AS "Average Price" FORMAT "DECIMAL_2";
    SORT_BY Revenue DESC;
}
```
Step 3: Run the Report
```
python main_report.py sales_report.rdsl
```
Step 4: Get The Output
```
✅ Report generated successfully!

📊 Table Output:
| Sales Region | Total Revenue | Units Sold | Average Price |
|--------------|---------------|------------|---------------|
| West         | Rp 12,500     | 50         | 250.00        |
| East         | Rp 8,300      | 35         | 237.14        |
| North        | Rp 4,750      | 20         | 237.50        |
